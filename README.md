# TBS5520SE Drivers

This repository contains the necessary information to build the TBS5520SE drivers on the Raspberry Pi 4.

This includes patch files that only remove certain drivers that are unnecessary and prevent the build and initialization processes from completing. All other drivers will be built, which takes about 45 minutes to complete.
